This repository contains R scripts used to generate distribution models and prediction maps of Vegetation types in Norway. The data is acompanying article: "Distribution modelling of vegetation types based on area-frame survey data" by authors: Horvath P, Halvorsen R, Stordal F, Tallaksen LM, Tang H, Bryn A  

Spatial data is available for download at the [DRYAD](doi:10.5061/dryad.nk3b5k8) repository .
